Jan 24:
I set up all the loops for the formatting of my ten guesses on the board.  I can now test 1 guess against the code "ABCD" and print a 2 for correct letter and corrcet place, 
a 1 for correct letter worng place, and a 0 for wrong letter wrong place.  For right now it only checks againt the four letters "ABCD".  It also now takes in user input for 
the first guess.  My next steps is to be able to take n multiple guess and check it mutiple times, then expand it to include the actually Mastermind colors.
